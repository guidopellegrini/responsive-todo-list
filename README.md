# Responsive Todo List Application

## Description

Welcome to the Responsive Todo List Application, a beautifully designed project aimed at managing your tasks seamlessly.

This application features a minimalist design with glasmorphism, showcasing the current date in a beautiful layout, a scrollable list of tasks, a button to delete all tasks, and persistence of tasks in local storage, ensuring that your data is retained even after page refresh.

Each task has two states: completed and pending, with the ability to toggle between them.

The application also includes a form for adding new tasks, where each task can include a date, start time, end time, and a message.

The form is validated to ensure that the end time is not earlier than the start time and that the date is not in the past.
